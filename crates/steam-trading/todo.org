* TODO

- Steam Auth needs to be modified, to allow custom requests whilst maintaining store cookies. This would be used to
create trade offers. To check the trade offer history, we only need the api key.

** Trade related
- Create a trade offer from the user logged in, to a determined STEAMID, requesting one or multiple asset ids, and
offering nothing or something. (trade can't be completely empty, at least one item needs to be requested or sent);
- Check for transition of trade offers status (?);

*** Notes

- Trades sent but not yet confirmed, do not show at the trade history API endpoint.
- TradeHistory can be used to get the new assetids of traded items.
- Trade URL endpoint: https://steamcommunity.com/tradeoffer/new/send
