# SteamHelper-rs

SteamHelper is (in the future) a modular Rust alternative to popular libraries as C# [SteamRE/SteamKit](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit), node.js [DoctorMcKay/node-steam-client](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-client), and Python [ValvePython/steam](https://github.com/ValvePython/steam), to enable interaction with the Steam Network through an easy to follow API.

It can be used to create bots, automate profiles, the possibilities are endless.

The library needs contributors. Check issues that need help and send those PRs in!
